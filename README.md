# phishingrod

## Create a basic Phishing Site with a single command.

*V1.0 Initial Release*

Phishing Rod is a shell script that can be applied to any basic debian machine that will install everything required to make a phishing site.

Its only a Version 1.0 so its all very ugly looking and doesn't do everything perfectly, but I'll be able to add to it as things go along.

The PHP code was lifted from the excellent Social Engineers Toolkit (because if it ain't broke......)

## To Do - Otherwise I will totally forget

* Log credentials to /opt/capture/ folder to prevent them going walkies on the web server.
* Automate Let's Encrypt.
* More example sites.
* High Fives!
